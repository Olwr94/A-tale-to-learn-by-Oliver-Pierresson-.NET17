Me and my partner, Jimmy Fallon took this case not because we have any hope in finding the guilty one. But it's a simple matter between 
sitting by the desk all day, or fieldwork. Me and Jimmy are very alike in the manor of liking the outoors, not that you can call this sordid 
city the outdoors, but it's the best we've got. We make our way to the car and head towards the inner part of the city as we have the sirens
going. Jimmy is the driver and im the spotter, always have been and always will be.
