Few weeks has passed since the murder on 147th street. Me and Jimmy put together a team of trusted colleagues to throw this John of his high horse.
We've put together a high risk plan, strictly unofficial. The time of his tyrani has come to an end.
We will hit his escort during a huge meetup between him and his thralls. While we draw attention, Jimmy will take a shot with his sniper rifle
from a distance to take out the big boss. 
Jimmy was a sniper during the world war, and has 36 confirmed eliminations. I trusted his capabilities.
We intercepted the ecort a few miles away from the meetup point, and draws fire. I see John getting out of his car with a Clarissa
and John just drops down to the ground while Clarrisa is screaming. Before I new it i hear the shot from Jimmys rifle from a distance, it came just a split second after
John and Clarrisa hit the ground, but it felt like ages.
