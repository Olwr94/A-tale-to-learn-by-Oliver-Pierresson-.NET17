The year is 1948. My name is Nicholas Cage, and i live in L.A. Walking the streets of downtown really makes you ralize what a sordid dark underbelly of a city this is.
A city that shines as dimond from one of jupiters moons, but is faker than a cubic zirconium. You can see it in the faces of people, and the
differences between those trying too hard to make it and those trying really hard to survive. The streets bustle with the atmosphere of hope
and desperation throughout the daytime, it clings to you, like the stench of a cigarette smoke after leaving a cramped bar with no ventilation.
But during the late hours, these are really lonley streets, where the neon lights only serve to reflect off the broken whiskey bottles
and tears of lost souls falling into the gutter. The beauty of L.A only masks it's cruelness, and she's one evil braud if you don't have a
dime in your pocket. She'll laugh as you fall and kick you when you're down. Then walk away with the next gullible sucker, ready to do it all over again.
Who ever called this town "The city of angels" never realized that this place could be so full of demons.
