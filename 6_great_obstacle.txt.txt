Damn, didn't think we would find anything, but while searching the still warm corpse, i realize he has a little paper note in his inner
pocket of his jacket. "Where is my bloody money, Jerry?!", and it was even signed.. "John Falconie". This was obviously a gangster hit,
and this poor bastard owed too much to be able to pay back. Must've been drugrelated. What scares me is that Falconie has a majority of the
LAPD officers in his pocket. Perfect..!
